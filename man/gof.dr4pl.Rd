\description{
Perform the goodness-of-fit (gof) test for the 4PL model when there
  are at least two replicates for each dose level.
}
\details{
Perform the goodness-of-fit (gof) test for the 4PL model in which the
  mean response actually follws the 4 Parameter Logistic model. There should
  be at least two replicates at each dose level. The test statistic follows the
  Chi squared distributions with the (n - 4) degrees of freedom where n is the
  number of observations and 4 is the number of parameters in the 4PL model. For
  detailed explanation of the method, please refer to Subsection 2.1.5 of

  Probability and Mathematical Statistics: Probability and Mathematical
  Statistics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.
