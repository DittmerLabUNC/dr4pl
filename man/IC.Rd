\title{Obtain Inhibitory Concentrations (IC) of a dose-response curve}
\usage{
IC(object, levels.percent)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of the class `dr4pl` for which the IC values are obtained}

\item{levels.percent}{Percentage of the level at which thc IC is obtained}
}
\value{
IC values at the percentage levels provided by the argument \code{percent}
}
\description{
This function obtains estimates of the IC's of a dose-response 
curve. Typically the IC50 parameter is of interest, but sometimes IC10 or IC90
are important aspects of a dose-response curve. By controlling the function
argument, a user can obtain the IC's at various levels.

\examples{
data.test <- data.frame(x = c(0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1),
                        y = c(10, 9, 5, 1, 0))
dr4pl.test <- dr4pl(y ~ x,
                    data = data.test)
IC(dr4pl.test, levels.percent = c(10, 90))
