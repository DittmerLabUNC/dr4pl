\title{Private function to fit the 4PL model to dose-response data}
\usage{
dr4plEst(dose, response, init.parm, trend, method.init, method.optim,
  method.robust)
}
\arguments{
\item{dose}{Vector of dose levels}

\item{response}{Vector of responses}

\item{init.parm}{Vector of initial parameters of the 4PL model supplied by a
user.}

\item{trend}{Indicator of whether a dose-response curve is a decreasing 
\eqn{\theta[3]<0} or increasing curve \eqn{\theta[3]>0}. The default is "auto" 
which indicates that the trend of the curve is automatically determined by
data. The option "decreasing" will impose a restriction \eqn{\theta[3]<=0} 
while the option "increasing" will impose a restriction \eqn{\theta[3]>=0} in an 
optimization process.}

\item{method.init}{Method of obtaining initial values of the parameters.
Should be one of "logistic" for the logistic method or "Mead" for the Mead
method. The default option is the logistic method.}

\item{method.optim}{Method of optimization of the parameters. This argument
is directly delivered to the \code{constrOptim} function provided in the
"base" package of R.}

\item{method.robust}{Method of robust estimation. Should be one of the followings.
- NULL: Squares loss 
- absolute: Absolute deviation loss 
- Huber: Huber's loss 
- Tukey: Tukey's biweight loss}
}
\description{
Private function that actually fits the 4PL model to data. If the
  Hill bounds are attained at the end of optimization processes, then an
  indicator of convergence failure so that \code{\link{dr4pl.default}} can
  look for a remedy for convergence failure.
