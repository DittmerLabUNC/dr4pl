Title: Dose Response data analysis using the 4 Parameter Logistic model
Version: 0.1.0
Depends: R (>= 2.10)
Author: Hyowon An
Maintainer: Hyowon An <ahwbest@gmail.com>
Description: dr4pl models the relationship between dose levels 
and responses in a pharmacological experiment using the 4 Parameter
Logistic model. dr4pl currently only supports decreasing curves. 
To deal with a convergence failure problem of nonlinear regression 
models, this package supports features to detect convergence failure 
and presents some solutions to a user.
